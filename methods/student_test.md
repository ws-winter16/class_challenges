# Together let's create a testing application.
-

The app should have
* A class of student and the student should "login" with their email and password before they can take a test. 
* The user should be able to take the test and receive feedback on answers. 
* Their score should be saved and printed at the end of the test. 
* If they score under 60 they should be prompted to take the test again.
