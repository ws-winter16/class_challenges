# Together let's create a method that adds 1 to an array of numbers. 
-
Given an array of integers of any length, return an array that has 1 added to the value represented by the array.

For example an array [2, 3, 9] equals 239, add one would return an array [2, 4, 0].

[4, 3, 2, 5] would return [4, 3, 2, 6]
